I'm a PhD candidate in the School of Computing at the Australian National University (ANU), Canberra. My thesis topic is data preprocessing. **Specifically, I'm interested in developing visualisation tools for documenting and communicating data preprocessing decisions.** This research is conducted under the supervision of Professor Lexing Xie (ANU School of Computing), Dr. Petra Kuhnert (StatML in CSIRO's Data61), and Dr. Jenny L. Davis (ANU School of Sociology).

I'm a Data61 affiliate at CSIRO (Australia's national science organisation), a team member of the ANU's Humanising Machine Intelligence research initiative, and part of the Computational Media Lab at ANU. Prior to ANU, I completed a two-year post-bachelor fellowship at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, Seattle, where I modelled the health burden of non-fatal injuries on the Global Burden of Disease study. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Statistics from the University of Missouri, Columbia, and completed my undergraduate honours thesis on uncertainty visualisation in spatial statistics under the supervision of Professor Christopher K. Wikle.

My research interests include data preprocessing, data provenance, and data visualisation. I enjoy building visualisation systems in R and being a part of interdisciplinary research teams.

# Current Projects

The uniting theme between these projects is visualising information, from/about a data analysis, that is often overlooked in research dissemination, despite its relevance to our understanding and interpretation of the data analysis.
