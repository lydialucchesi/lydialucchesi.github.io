I'm a PhD candidate at the Australian National University, Canberra. My thesis topic is data preprocessing. Specifically, I'm interested in developing a visualisation system to communicate data preprocessing decisions. This research is conducted under the supervision of Professor Lexing Xie, Dr. Petra Kuhnert, and Dr. Jenny Davis.
